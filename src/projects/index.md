# My Projects

Here's a collection of projects I've worked on:

- [**Soundscape Cartography**](https://github.com/sucramual/Soundscape-Cartography): an interactive dashboard that applies clustering analysis to Spotify audio features, offering an alternative to traditional genre classifications by enabling users to compare songs based on characteristics such as danceability and speechiness.

- [**LLM Cantonese Response Comparison**](https://github.com/sucramual/PyCon-Project)(with [Winnie Yeung](https://vionwinnie.github.io/)): a streamlit [application](https://pycon-project-2024.streamlit.app/) that explores the gap between large language models and specialized finetuned models in processing Cantonese content.
