# About Me

I'm originally from Hong Kong and currently reside in Atlanta. I'm pursuing a Master in Analytics at Georgia Tech with a concentration in computational data analysis. 

Previously, I worked on strategy and analytics at a Hong Kongâ€“based e-commerce marketplace and spent time in investment banking at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse (now UBS).

I graduated from the University of Hong Kong with honours in political science and philosophy. Drawing from my interdisciplinary background, I'm especially interested in how geopolitics, business and technology can shape a more equitable and free world. Beyond these intersections, I also think a lot about financial markets, food and canto pop.

The best way to get in touch would be to email at ylau36[at]gatech.edu. I am also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcuslauyc/), [Github](https://github.com/sucramual) and maybe soon X.
