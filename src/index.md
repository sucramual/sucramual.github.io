# About Me

I'm originally from Hong Kong and recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a [Master in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) with a concentration in Machine Learning. Professionally, I'm focused on LLM inference, specifically building the scalable infrastructure and robust evaluation frameworks needed to deploy models reliably. Outside of work, I love cooking and being outdoors. In my past life, I was a tech investment banker with a short stint at a French restaurant mostly making sauces.

The best way to get in touch would be to email at ylau36[at]gatech.edu. I am also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcuslauyc/), [Github](https://github.com/sucramual) and [X](https://x.com/ylau36).
